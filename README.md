  The point of sale (POS) system provides a convenient way of checking out customers and recording activities. It helps to keep records on store inventory, order history, return order history, user details, transaction history, payments, order and history of sold items on a particular day. It can also print out receipts, carry out credit card processing, manage users, allow payments securely, updating them when an order is processed.  
  POS gives the flexibility of checking the recorded history that helps to make a final decision. 
  The point-of-sale system allows users to input via keyboard or mouse, and some even have a barcode reader. Using the system enables one to print out receipts and reports.
